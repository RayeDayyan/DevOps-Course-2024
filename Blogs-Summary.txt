Hello my name is Raye Dayyan,in here I'll summarize the two blogs that I've written during this DevOps Course.
Link to the first blog : https://medium.com/@dayyanahmad12377/pulseviz-ecg-re-imagined-6ee8b5df01f1

So in this blog, I wrote about the project that me and my team have been working on as our FYP namely 'PulseViz'.For the past many decades, ECG has been mainly used for heart-health analysis and it has been widely used for heart attack detection , 
but the analysis of heart health through ECG can be very time consuming which resultantly can cause problems for the patients , in some severe cases even fatalities , this is where we come in . We propose a solution , that is going to revolutionize
how the Medical world works , by making this whole-lot process faster , efficient and accurate. So, using our app the ECG can be analyzed within just 3 simple interactions and you can have the ECG results within just 10 seconds of submission making things alot more easier and efficient.

Link to the second blog : https://medium.com/@dayyanahmad12377/what-exactly-is-minikube-2372b8a5989f

The second blog I wrote was about MiniKube an extremely essential tool in the DevOps World. MiniKube is like a mini version of Kubernetes (K8s) that is used for testing and learning purposes because directly jumping onto the Kubernetes can be very expensive in terms of
resources as well as money.So,this tool is to help amateaurs get hands on experience with the Kubernetes world as both the MiniKube and Kubernetes work in a very similar way.In this blog,I covered the background need for MiniKube,how is it different from Kubernetes,how it works
and how you can use it to your advantage along with a conclusion.
