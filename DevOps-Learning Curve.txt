I am going to be totally honest here,the only thing I knew about DevOps world before taking this course was that DevOps stood for 'Development Operations'.But upon the completion of this course I can proudly say that I have a decent knowledege about how things work in
the DevOps world and can efficiently use that knowledge into practical life for the whole CI/CD cycle of a project.

Following I tried to mention everything that I learned throughout this course : 

0.Git and GitHub

I honestly had a very little experience working with GitHub but after this project I have a deep practical understanding of the whole version control.

1. DevOps Foundation and Culture

Understanding the core principles of collaboration between development and operations teams
Embracing automation and continuous improvement mindset
Implementing feedback loops and measuring key metrics
Adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices
Focusing on security integration (DevSecOps)

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform
Declarative infrastructure provisioning
State management and remote backends

3. Container Technologies

Docker
Container fundamentals and image management
Dockerfile optimization techniques
Multi-stage builds
Docker Compose for local development
Learning Path:

7. CI/CD Implementation

Pipeline automation with various tools:
Jenkins
Deployment strategies:
Blue-green deployments
Canary releases
Rolling updates
Integration with:
Automated testing
